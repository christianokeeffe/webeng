\section{Application Bottleneck}
When developing an web-application it is important to design it, so it can handle a lot of traffic. A method to help the developers in creating a robust design in terms of performance is to look for bottlenecks in your web application. When a bottleneck is located you either looks for the source on a hardware level or on the code level. With the source to problem it is now up to the developers to solve it one way or another.

A bottleneck in our web application could generally be our database. A problem could arise when a lot of users uses the function to update the database which means our database needs to handler a lot of update request at once. A similar problem could be when a lot of users would request the country web page.

Another bottleneck could be when a lot of users wants to see some potential complex statistic of a lot of data, which would put the server under a lot of calculation pressure as well as wait for the database to handle the request.
