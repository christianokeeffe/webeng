\section{Usage Analysis}
A usage analysis is a analysis method were you look the web log for your servers. In general you will need to extend these logs with additional information in order to perform the more in depth analysis.

Usage analysis can provide a variety of information of your web application which you can use to derive an array of things from. It can for example be used to find out which pages in your web application are used and which of the pages that are the most demanded. The analysis can also uncover pages which are not reachable or pages which are not used at all by looking at the number of requests and which pages their are requesting.
The analysis can also be used to find missing links by observing the navigation pattern of the users and thereby determine abnormal behavior.

With usage analysis we use the benefits that this method provides to improve our web application. We could for example use it for understand the users behavior and optimize our web applications navigation. We can also use it to find unused pages and functionality, and evaluate if they need a redesign to fit the users needs more or be removed.

To use it we would have to extend our web logs and design analysis models to actually extract the wanted information our of the logs. To extend our web logs we could use e.g. use log4php, a library for extending the web logs for php applications.
