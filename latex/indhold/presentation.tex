\section{Presentation}
For our web application we have used concrete presentation design method to structure how our application should be presented to the consumers. This method was chosen over abstract data view and abstract presentation design because it allows us to model our application on a more detailed level while others might omit some of the details. Another attractive feature of the concrete presentation method it uses objects in its model.

We have the design a application \textit{top menu} which contains links for the consumers to navigate through the application. For each page in our application we have different presentation bodies containing the specific pages content presented in e.g. tables.
