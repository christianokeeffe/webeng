\section{Test of xQuary}
The Mondial dataset was used as test set for quarried with xQuary using the program BaseX. We found it a simple and very effective way of selecting and quary an XML file. It is not used for this application, due to the problems of using xQuary with PHP. We tried to restrict the set to just the country Denmark using xQuary, which worked perfectly, but as we save our data using MySQL in our application, it is not a problem, as the SQL language is supported by php and fine for quarrying in the application.
