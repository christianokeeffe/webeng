\section{Analysis of Control Flow Graph}
This control flow graph can be used to specify unittests for our application, as we can see which paths that should be accessed to test the program fully. It can be seen, that the \textit{objectToChangeToo} variable is the essential variable, in regard to which path is followed. When writing the unittest, this variable should be assigned to take both paths and thereby explore the whole program.
Furthermore, the graph makes is possible to see at which state the variables is changed, and thereby in which state of the program the variable's state should be verified.
