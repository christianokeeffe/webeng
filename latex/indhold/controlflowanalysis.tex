\section{Analysis of Control Flow Graph}
This control flow graph can be used to specify your unittests, as we can see which paths that should be accessed to test the program fully. It can be seen, that the objectToChangeToo variable is the essential variable, in regard to which path is followed. When writing the unittest, this variable should be tested in regard to make the program choose the right path.
Furthermore, the graph makes is possible to see at which state the variables is changed, and thereby in which that the unittest should verify the state of the variable.
