\section{Web Service Solutions}
An attractive feature for a web application could be to providing services that other applications can use to interact it. To provide this functionality different methods such as: shared database, remote producer call, message bus and file transfer been developed.

Shared database can work for multiple applications within the same organization but on a larger scale involving multiple organization it an very insecure solution and even more complex to pull off.

File transfer poses a better alternative to a shared database but still comes with inconveniences. Before a computer/application can reach a file, it must know on which address the file is located and establish a connection to the server to fetch the file through.
