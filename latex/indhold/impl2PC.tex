\section{2 Phase Commit Protocol}
2 phase commit protocol (2PC) purpose is, to ensure every function in a group is evaluated, or no function is evaluated. This will ensure that if an error occurs in one function, the other functions are rolled back, so no wrong value is stored. An example of a use of this, could be an exchange of values, e.g. money for a product. If something goes wrong, so the money is not delivered, the product should not be sent.
2PC is implemented by a coordinator and a number of participants. The coordinator will coordinate the participants, starting by sending a prepare statement to each participants. If each of the participants return yes, the coordinator send the commit statement to each of the participants, which will commit their prepared log. An example can of this can be seen on \Cref{fig:2PC}

An implementation of 2PC in our project could be between the commercial site providing advertising and our site. The value exchange between these two sites could be validated by 2PC. Another solution could be in the back-end, if multiple tables should be updated. It could be validated that each table update would be performed correctly, and alternatively roll back the changes. In this case back-end would be the coordinator for 2CP, with the database as one of the participants.
