\section{Possible Attacks on Our Application}
Our application has a lot of problems in regard to security.
As example, no input field, e.g. on the edit country page, is validated. The input values should of course be validated and escaped to ensure that e.g. SQL injection is not possible.
The login has not been implemented, so it is possible for everyone to use our edit country method. The API of the application do not use any API keys or other authentication, which will make it very easy to abuse our API. The API does not validate the inputs, of escape the inputs, which again make SQL injection possible.
The site does not take care of encodings or overflows either.
