\section{Performance Test}
Our application should be performances tested, to ensure the stability and user experience when the system would be released and hopefully used a lot. This could be done, by generating traffic to our site, e.g. by the use of unit tests. Back Box testing should be used to test load time, and ensure that the site is performing fast enough with greater traffic.
This should be followed by white box testing, which could reveal the internal performance, and thereby finding the bottlenecks.
This could be to see the performance index of the network and the CPU utilization, and thereby determine if the bottleneck if because of network problems, or it is due to heavy computations. This could be solved by changing the software, or upgrading the hardware.
Furthermore, the number of function calls and percentage of time spend on each part of a program, can tell which parts of the program to optimize to get a better performance.
