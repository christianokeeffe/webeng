\section{Implementation of AB-testing}
In AB-testing, users are randomly exposed to two versions of a page, giving the possibility to compare the results, finding the best version of the site.

If we were to implement AB-testing in our project, we would need resources not given for this mini project. It could be possible for us to implement the coding part of AB-testing if given enough time, but we do not have the users for our page, compared to the number needed for performing an AB-test. 

If we pretend we would have the needed resources, AB-testing could be implemented by making two different views of a page, e.g. the edit country page. This could easily be done, as it is only the view that should be changed, and the functionality could be preserved from the model and controller. We could then make two views of the edit country page, with two different layouts, and measure the speed, or how easy the user changes the country, to make the page as effective as possible.
