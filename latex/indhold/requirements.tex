To decide what our applications functionality should be, we will look into the requirements of application and discuss what is important. We start by looking into what the goals for the application are.

A goal for our application is to provide a geographical database for the users, providing a service where they can find relevant information in relation to their search. Developments can in the same way use the service in their application to retrieve information from the database. Another goal could be to provide a tool or service for updating the geographical data in the database. We will provide an example of how one of these goals can be analyzed.

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Actors:} The actors are the users of the web application and us as the providers. 
\item \textbf{Goals:} To provide the users with information relevant to their search in return for viewing some advertisement.
\item \textbf{Tasks:} One tasks is to keep the database updated so the users always have access to relevant information. Another tasks is to query the users search to the database and present the result to the users.
\item \textbf{Resources:} The resource we can provide is the information while the users provide us with views.
\item \textbf{Soft goals:} That the users are satisfied with the services we provide and they meets their expectations.
\item \textbf{Dependencies:} For our web application to work it is dependent on a connection to the server.

\end{itemize}

With the goal in place, we now look at the value exchanges in the between the users and our application. One value exchange could be between the normal users where we provide relevant information to their search together with some advertisements which the users will see together with the information. The income will be through a value exchange point between our application and the advertisement company, where we provide them with views while they provide us payment for the views.

There would also be a value exchange between the our application and the geographical data administrates where we provide them with the database and service to update it while they provide us with updated information.
