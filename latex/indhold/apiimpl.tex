\section{Implementation}
To enable the use of routing, the Fat-Free Framework is used. 
Each route should specify which part that should be acceced. As an example, if you GET to "api/country", it will return the list of countries. You can also get a specific county if you GET to "api/country/@id". If you want to edit a country, you simply POST to "api/country/@id".
An example can be seen on 
\begin{code}{lst:api}{The API method for getting the list of countries.}
\begin{lstlisting}
$f3->route('GET /country',
    function($f3) {
        echo json_encode($f3->cmodel->listOfCountries);
    }
);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{code}

The way of using routing was found easy to understand - both for the developers and for the users of the API. 
To communicate with the database, the API use the model classes made to our application.
