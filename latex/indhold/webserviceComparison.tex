\subsection{Comparison}
SOAP provides a lot of customization in terms of request and response, but it also require more processing of the response while REST uses a light-weight format which is easily processed. SOAP also takes a lot for work for setting up while REST is more friendly in that aspect. SOAP at the other hand provides more security while REST requires a bit of implementation to encrypt the transactions.

We choose the REST architecture because it covers the needs our application have in terms of transaction. It is also more desired because the much easier to implement rather than SOAP.
