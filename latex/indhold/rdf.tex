\section{RDF/RDFS}
RDF is an extension of the XML language, which consists of a triple containing a resource, a property and a value.
Is a a way of organizing your XML file with this tuple, making it easier to search and storing data.

It has been implemented in our project, by the possibility to export the list of countries with some attributes to a RDF file. We used a PHP library, EasyRDF, to present our data.

We found this way of organizing your data convenient to some purposes, as it is can be structured very close to our internal class representation. It is a format intended for computers, and not humans, with the purpose to store the information for a computer to read later. Thereby you can utilize this format to store information or transfer through file transport in a effective manner because the format is optimized for computers to read. The EasyRDF was very easy to use and implement, and the RDF format was in general an easy but effective extension of the XML language.
