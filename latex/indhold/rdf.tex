\section{RDF/RDFS}
RDF is an extension of the XML language, which consists of a triple containing a resource, a property and a value.
Is a a way of organizing your XML file with this tuple, making it easier to search and storing data.

It has been implemented in our project, by the possibility to export the list of countries with some attributes to a RDF file. We used a PHP library, EasyRDF, to present our data.

We found this way of organizing your data as convenient to some purposes, as it is can be structured very close to our internal class representation. It is a format intended for computers, and not computers, but as the purpose was to store the information for a computer to read later, this is not disadvantage.
The EasyRDF was very easy to use and implement, and the RDF format was in general an easy but effective extension of the XML language.
