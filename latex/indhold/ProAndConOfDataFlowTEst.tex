\section{Advantages and Disadvantages of Data Flow Testing}
An advantage of data flow testing is that it allows the developer to find errors at a very low level of the application and helps for pinpointing the location and cause of the error. This feature is a consequence of following the data flow very closely.

Another advantages is that the data flow test provides a system that you as a developer can use to test your application on different levels as: function level, object level and application level.

A disadvantage is that the data flow requires a lot of time to preform on large complex systems, a workaround is to only preform the test on the most important functions. Another disadvantage is that the data flow graphs, used in the testing, easily gets outdated and needs a lot of maintains to keep it up to date if changes are made to the program.
