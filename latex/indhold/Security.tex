\section{Security}
Security is an important part of designing a web application because a vulnerable system can result in the attackers exploiting the system to personal use and potentially hurt the users of the system.

Some of the areas the attackers could exploit, to gain authenticated access to your web application, are: buffer overflow, input validation attack, format string attack, SQL injection, access control weakness, authentication and session.

In an attack by exploiting buffer overflow, the attacker overflows a variable through input field in the web application and forces a system error. In a input validation the attacker tries to exploit input fields which certain input e.i. string escape followed by a SQL statement, also known as a SQL injection. A SQL injection attack can be used to extract data from the database, to delete the database or to store procedures to deny users access to a service or execute remote commands. A format string attack the attacker tries to provoke a system error through parsing e.g. a string value to a integer variable. In a access control weakness attack the attacker exploits weak points in the API e.i. calls to the API that have no or weak access control. In the authentication and session attack the attacker exploit e.i. a cookie to gain user access to a web application.
