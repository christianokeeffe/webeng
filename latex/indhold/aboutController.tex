\section{About the Controller}
To provide behavior to the application and allow the users to interact with the data their are presented with, we create a controller for the relevant views. The controllers will be responsible for providing the applications functionality. We have chosen to use the page controller structure instead of application controller because it is more suited for simple behavior while application controller structure fits a more sequential structure.
