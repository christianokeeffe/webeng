\section{Advantages and Disadvantages of AB Testing}
An advantage of A/B testing is that it allows the developers to test a new design compared to the current design. The test is measured through a series evaluation criteria. The developers can then use the result of test to evaluate the new design and check it actual improves the product compared to the old design.

Another advantage is that, it is fairly easy to implement A/B testing if the application uses the MVC pattern. The reason for this, is that you have to create a view for the new design and redirect to it, so both the model and controller can be reused.

A disadvantage of A/B testing is that it requires a lot of users to be able to provide a result that can be used. Another disadvantage of A/B testing is that it requires some time to implement the rerouting of users and if it is a complex system that already reroutes to internal servers, even more hardware power is needed to reroute the users to the test pages. Furthermore, you will use time on develop at least one design, which must be working, but will be discarded.
